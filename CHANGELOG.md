# Changelog for Module PSModule-Personal

Started to use as many commonly used defaults to setup a Microsoft PowerShell module where changes and readme are part of.  
Help the PowerShell way is used for sure, but the community also uses some commonly used standards.  
Not sure yet, but maybe these files ( _CHANGELOG.md_ and _README.md_ ) will be small and point to the Microsoft PowerShell way of supplying help.
